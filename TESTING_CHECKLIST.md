# End-to-End Testing Checklist

Use this checklist when testing the tutorial to identify areas that might confuse entry-level users.

## üß™ Testing Setup

### Test Environment
- [ ] Use a clean machine/VM if possible (or fresh terminal session)
- [ ] Don't use existing AWS/Docker knowledge to "fix" things
- [ ] Time each step and compare to our estimates
- [ ] Note every point of confusion or hesitation

### Testing Mindset
- [ ] Act as a complete beginner
- [ ] Follow instructions exactly as written
- [ ] Don't skip verification steps
- [ ] Note when you have to guess or assume something

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing

### README Review
- [ ] Is the repository URL instruction clear?
- [ ] Are the time estimates realistic?
- [ ] Do the quick start commands work as expected?
- [ ] Is the setup script instruction clear?

### Prerequisites Testing
- [ ] Does `./scripts/setup.sh` run without permission issues?
- [ ] Are error messages helpful if tools are missing?
- [ ] Is AWS CLI configuration guidance sufficient?
- [ ] Are the permission requirements clear?

### Local Testing
- [ ] Does Docker build work on first try?
- [ ] Is the local testing step clear (port 3000 vs 80)?
- [ ] How do users stop the Docker container?
- [ ] Does the health check endpoint work locally?

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Is each Copilot command clear about what it does?
- [ ] Are the expected outputs accurate?
- [ ] Do the time estimates match reality?
- [ ] Are error recovery instructions sufficient?

### Master Key Handling
- [ ] Is it clear where to find the master key?
- [ ] Are copy/paste instructions foolproof?
- [ ] What happens if the key is wrong?

### Final Verification
- [ ] Is the final URL easy to find and use?
- [ ] Does the deployed app actually work?
- [ ] Are the cleanup instructions clear?

## üîç Things to Watch For

### Clarity Issues
- [ ] Ambiguous pronouns ("this will do...")
- [ ] Unexplained technical terms
- [ ] Missing context for why we're doing something
- [ ] Instructions that could be interpreted multiple ways

### User Experience Issues
- [ ] Steps that feel too long or complex
- [ ] Missing feedback/confirmation that something worked
- [ ] Unclear error messages or recovery steps
- [ ] Assumptions about user knowledge

### Technical Issues
- [ ] Commands that don't work as written
- [ ] Missing dependencies or setup steps
- [ ] Incorrect file paths or names
- [ ] Version compatibility problems

## üìù Documentation Issues to Note

### For Each Step, Check:
- [ ] **Purpose**: Is it clear WHY we're doing this?
- [ ] **Process**: Are the commands/steps clear?
- [ ] **Verification**: How do I know it worked?
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: What if it doesn't work?

### Common Problem Areas:
- [ ] Directory navigation confusion
- [ ] File permission issues
- [ ] Network/connectivity problems
- [ ] AWS credential/permission issues
- [ ] Docker daemon not running
- [ ] Port conflicts
- [ ] Copy/paste formatting issues

## üö® Error Scenarios to Test

### Intentional Failures
- [ ] What happens if Docker isn't running?
- [ ] What if AWS credentials are wrong?
- [ ] What if the master key is incorrect?
- [ ] What if a deployment step fails halfway?

### Recovery Testing
- [ ] Can users easily restart from a failed step?
- [ ] Are cleanup instructions sufficient?
- [ ] Do troubleshooting guides actually help?

## üìä Feedback Collection

### For Each Issue Found:
- **Location**: Which file/step?
- **Issue**: What was confusing?
- **Impact**: How much did it slow you down?
- **Suggestion**: How could we fix it?

### Overall Assessment:
- **Time**: How long did it actually take?
- **Difficulty**: Rate 1-10 for a beginner
- **Clarity**: What was most/least clear?
- **Missing**: What should we add?

## üéØ Success Criteria

The tutorial passes testing if:
- [ ] A beginner could follow it without getting stuck
- [ ] All commands work as written
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Error messages lead to solutions
- [ ] The final result works as expected
- [ ] Cleanup instructions prevent ongoing costs
